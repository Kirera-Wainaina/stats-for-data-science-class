# p value
# DEF: the probability, if H0 (null hypothesis) is true, of obtaining the observations or an observation more extreme.

# small p-values mean evidence against the null.
# <= 0.05

# if p is smaller than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and infer the coin is biased.
# if p is not smaller then 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

# sd of mean= sd/sqrt(mean)

# if we have >= 30 observations, then sd(data) is "close enough".
# if n < 30, this is a problem
